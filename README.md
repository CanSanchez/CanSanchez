🔭 I’m currently working on Found, a web app that allows user to list their missing or found pets. 🐶🐱

🌱 I’m currently learning Python and can't wait to get started on Raspberry Pi and Arduino. 👾

⚡ Fun fact: My team and I won a gold medal in a hockey tournament in Abu Dhabi. 🏒

I bring together my passion for both development and design to create beautiful, functional and fun digital experiences. 🦄

I use CSS, HTML, JavaScript, React, and Next.js to create visually stunning and seamless user experiences for web and mobile applications. 
I'm skilled in Figma, Adobe Creative Suite, WordPress, SQL, and Git version control. 👾

In addition to my work, I'm an active volunteer in my community, including volunteering as a hockey program assistant instructor. 🏒

Let's create something amazing together! or we can grab a drink? 🍻

Let's connect! 🔌
